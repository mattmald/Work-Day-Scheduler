# Work-Day-Scheduler

 This week we had used JavaScript to make a work-day-scheduler that would allow it's user to easily orginaze their day, as well as have it automatically color code itself to to easily tell at what part of the day it was, when's coming up, and what has already passed. It would also meet certian Requritments such as saving all data on the page so when the user refreshed the page it would still show all items as they were.
